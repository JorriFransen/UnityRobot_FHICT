# Resources folder
In this folder, you can place sample video data you want the Vision module to process.
Please note that this folder has been added to the .gitignore as we don't want large files on the repository. The contents of this folder are automatically copied to the build directory for easy referencing.

You can find the sample video data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4kc2adgtRMLY1gwdkEwcS1KaDQ?usp=sharing).
