# Samples folder
In this folder, the Vision module will place samples generated during calibration.
If you want, you can place earlier generated samples here as well. In the config.yml you need to append the 'sampleNames' array to include the filename (without extension) in order to feed it into the detector.

This folder has been added to the .gitignore as we don't want large files on the repository. The contents of this folder are automatically copied to the build directory for easy referencing.

You can find the sample data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4kc2adgtRMLY1gwdkEwcS1KaDQ?usp=sharing).
