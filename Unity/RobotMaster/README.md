# Unity
To successfully run the Unity project, generated code from google protobuffer definitions are required. (More information [here](../../proto/README.md).)

## Unit Testing
[Unity Test Tools] are used for testing unity scripts/behaviour. More information on how to write tests [here][1], and [here (MonoBehaviours)][2]. Official documentation can be found [here][3].

Unity (C#/mono) networking tests can be found [here][4]. These tests can be run from the Unity editor (Window -> Editor Test Runner -> Run All).
