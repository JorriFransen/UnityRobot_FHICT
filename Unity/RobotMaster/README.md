# Unity
To successfully run the Unity project, generated code from google protobuffer definitions are required. (More information [here](../../proto/README.md).)

## Unit Testing
[Unity Test Tools](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/13802) are used for testing unity scripts/behaviour. More information on how to write tests [here](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/07/28/unit-testing-at-the-speed-of-light-with-unity-test-tools/), and [here (MonoBehaviours)](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/06/03/unit-testing-part-2-unit-testing-monobehaviours/). Official documentation can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/unitytesttools/wiki/Home).

Unity (C#/mono) networking tests can be found [here](./Assets/scripts/Networking/Tests/Editor/). These tests can be run from the Unity editor (Window -> Editor Test Runner -> Run All).
